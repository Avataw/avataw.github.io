        <h2 id="rating-your-performance"><strong>Rating your performance</strong></h2><p>As a developer it‚Äôs not always easy to know if you are doing a good job.</p><p>We cannot simply count the amount of produce we helped make as it is a bit more abstract than that, we produce code - which is basically text after all.</p><p>Counting the lines of code written can be quite a misleading metric though.
Especially while refactoring or bugfixing you can be super productive <em>deleting lines</em>, resulting in a negative amount of lines written.</p><p>New features are often described as <em>user stories</em>, maybe we could just count the amount of user stories implemented and deployed to production?</p><p>Sure, that‚Äôs definitely an improvement, but <em>not all user stories are created equal</em>. Some might take several days or weeks to implement, others could be finished in a matter of hours.</p><p>And now ask yourself this, if you spent several months on some user stories, finally deliver and the <em>user hates them</em> - are you doing a good job?</p><h2 id="lean-methodology-to-the-rescue"><strong>Lean methodology to the rescue!</strong></h2><p>Recently I‚Äôve read <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/">the lean startup by Eric Ries</a><sup><a href="#user-content-fn-lean" id="user-content-fnref-lean" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">1</a></sup> and there was a part about validated learning that really resonated with me.</p><p>I don‚Äôt want to paraphrase too much as it‚Äôs a great book and you should read it, basically Eric Ries suggests adding a validation step before stories are considered done.</p><p>It should be the responsibility of the development team to make sure that the changes made to the code actually provide a benefit.
And in order to <em>prove</em> that, meaningful metrics need to be introduced.</p><p>For example, let‚Äôs say you implemented several form validation rules.
You could track if the amount of API-requests containing form errors go down.</p><p>Or maybe you could sit down with the users and observe if they react to the new form validation rules as expected.</p><p>Wait a second, let <em>developers talk to users</em>? That‚Äôs absurd! <strong>/s</strong></p><h2 id="hiding-developers-in-the-basement"><strong>Hiding developers in the basement</strong></h2><p>I don‚Äôt know about you, but all too often I‚Äôve worked in teams that were deliberately kept away from the users they wrote sofware for.</p><p>Often it‚Äôs product managers or product owners minimizing the interaction between developers and users by working as some sort of proxy.</p><p>Their intentions might be justified, maybe they want to protect the developers from demotivating or unconstructive feedback. Maybe the client themselves are too busy or important and letting the developers observe them use new features might suggest unprofessionalism somehow<sup><a href="#user-content-fn-unprofessionalism" id="user-content-fnref-unprofessionalism" data-footnote-ref aria-describedby="footnote-label">2</a></sup>.</p><p>And I‚Äôm sure not every developer wants to talk to their users all the time anyway, it‚Äôs just that way too often there is a lot of distance between them making it difficult for conversations to get started even if they wanted to.</p><p>Other times I got the feeling that the base assumption is that <em>no developer</em> wants to talk to users <em>ever</em>.</p><p>Personally I love talking to my users, I always get super motivated afterwards! And I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôm no exception.</p><h2 id="why-i-build-sofware"><strong>Why I build sofware</strong></h2><p>Developers have different reasons why they code and what motivates them.</p><p>There are several approaches to categorizing developers and I‚Äôve personally found the <a href="https://josephg.com/blog/3-tribes/">3 tribes of programming</a> very helpful as I notice these 3 archetypes in my daily life as well:</p><blockquote>
<ul>
<li>You are a poet and a mathematician. Programming is your poetry</li>
<li>You are a hacker. You make hardware dance to your tune</li>
<li>You are a maker. You build things for people to use</li>
</ul>
</blockquote><p>In my case, I strongly identify with the <em>maker</em>. I write code in order to build things that help people.</p><p>Consequently I get frustrated whenever I notice that barely anyone uses the software I write, or if it is not helpful in the first place.</p><h2 id="happiness-"><strong>Happiness üåà</strong></h2><p>Therefore implementing validated learning into my workflow by monitoring if the changes I make provide any value, not only helps me do a good job - it also makes me feel happy.</p><p>Let me validate that I‚Äôm actually providing <em>value</em>.</p><p>Let me feel <em>validated</em> and <em>valued</em>.</p><p>I ‚ù§ the feeling of helping people with code - so please don‚Äôt try to hide me from the users :D</p><section data-footnotes class="footnotes"><h2 id="footnote-label" class="sr-only">Footnotes</h2>
