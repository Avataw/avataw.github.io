        <p>Happy last day of February everyone!</p><p>The last two days I partook in one of my favourite activities - Hackathons!</p><p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackathon">hackathon</a> being a fun event where you get a limited time to develop
something - in this case something related to social and/or art as the event name indicates:
<a href="https://artsocial21.org/">#ArtSocial21</a></p><h4 id="distributive-justice">DISTRIBUTIVE JUSTICE</h4><p>So the topic of the team I was assigned to was <strong>distributive justice</strong>.
My awesome team consisting of higher ups from several social institutions in my area and I got some very interesting
insights into the daily business of social workers.</p><p>After some brainstorming we came up with the following app ideas to pursue:</p><ol>
<li><strong>DESK SURFING</strong> allow less people to use your home office for a job interview or proctored exam</li>
<li><strong>LIFE SUPPORT</strong> a chat bot directs you to a fitting support institution in your area.</li>
<li><strong>HOBBY</strong> everyone should get the chance to try out several hobbies to find theirs.</li>
</ol><h4 id="we-chose-the-hobby-app">We chose the Hobby App</h4><p>I don‚Äôt really know why anymore ¬Ø\<em>(„ÉÑ)</em>/¬Ø , just from gathering feedback from friends I guess :D</p><p>The app is supposed to be as easy to use as possible and invite people to use it through it‚Äôs happy and playful vibe.</p><p>We also talked about how social workers could use it for the people they help.</p><h4 id="coming-up-with-the-design">Coming up with the design</h4><p>Recently I have started to dabble a bit with design. Which can be fun!</p><p>So I designed the logo and some mock ups on <a href="https://www.figma.com/">Figma</a> - a design tool that I have
recently fallen in love with - not only because it is written in <a href="https://www.figma.com/blog/rust-in-production-at-figma/">Rust</a>!</p><h5 id="the-logo">The Logo</h5><p>So I wanted to include multiple <em>fun colors</em> that are supposed to portray different activities that you try out on
your journey of finding the perfect hobby for you.</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/artsocialhackathon/hobbyLogo.png" alt="hobby logo"></p><p>The pointy rectangle in the back is supposed to be a stand-in for like a life without hobbies.</p><p>The name itself is just a WIP, I experimented with some other names like <strong>funby</strong> but meh, time was of the essence.</p><h5 id="mockups-of-the-main-workflow">Mockups of the main workflow</h5><p>A simple quiz is supposed to guide you to an activity-centered club around your location.</p><p><img src="/assets/blog/artsocialhackathon/hobbyWorkflow.png" alt="hobby workflow"></p><p>It was a lot of fun to adapt the thoughts behind the logo into the design of the single components.</p><h4 id="development">Development</h4><p>I used React in order to develop the app, in conjunction with the <a href="https://material-ui.com/">Material Design Library</a>
mostly because I am familiar with it and was looking forward to using the Grid Layout stuff.</p><p>Maybe I should look into a lightweight layout library for React ü§î.</p><p>Also I definitely need to look into how I can get funky CSS transforms working on mobile and bigger displays.</p><p>Because of the time constraint (I maybe got to work on the React project for like 2-3 hours max) I just constrained
the size on bigger displays to make it look like a mobile device, sorraaayy :D</p><h5 id="deployment">Deployment</h5><p>For deploying I just used netlify which was easy as heck.
Especially because the app currently does not use any backend as it‚Äôs just a prototype and the data is faked :‚Äò)</p><blockquote>
<p>‚ö†Ô∏è This is outdated, the app is not longer deployed!
Doesn‚Äôt matter because there is still nobody reading this blog anyways haha ‚Ä¶ <strong>sob</strong></p>
</blockquote><p><a href="https://eloquent-yalow-693b2c.netlify.app">Check the final app out here</a>!</p><p>Oh it‚Äôs german. Well. Luckily nobody reads this blog anyways :D</p><h4 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h4><p>Participating in Hackathons is an awesome and super inspiring experience I recommend to anyone!
That being said, this one was a bit of a weird one for me, as there was a huge focus on the final pitch and there
were only a handful of developers present at the event :/</p><p>Still, I learned a lot about social injustice and the amazing people in our society that put so much effort into
helping others.</p><p>Also I appreciate the privilege of having found several hobbies in my life that give my life meaning and connect
me to other people with similar passions all around the world.</p><p>I still feel so motivated and inspired by my team and other people I met there!</p><p>I ‚ù§ that and I am looking forward to my next Hackathon :).</p>
