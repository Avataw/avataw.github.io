<p>Show me your pull requests and I can tell you what your team is like.</p>
<p>There is a lot of interesting information hidden in your pull requests that might not be easily discernible on first glance.</p>
<p>Do some team members create a lot more pull requests than others?
-> You might have some knowledge silos in your team that prevent others from contributing at the same quantity</p>
<p>Is it always the same person reviewing all pull requests?
-> This could be a developer hoarding the ownership over all domains, not allowing others to decide what gets merged and what doesnâ€™t</p>
<p>I sincerely believe that many teams would benefit from analyzing their pull requests more.</p>
<p>Maybe this could even be automatically analyzed?</p>
<p>Well until then, feel free to read up on my suggestion on how to create and review pull requests <a href="../posts/pull-requests">how to pull pull requests off</a> here.</p>
