Show me your pull requests and I can tell you what your team is like.

There is a lot of interesting information hidden in your pull requests that might not be easily discernible on first glance.

Do some team members create a lot more pull requests than others?
-> You might have some knowledge silos in your team that prevent others from contributing at the same quantity

Is it always the same person reviewing all pull requests?
-> This could be a developer hoarding the ownership over all domains, not allowing others to decide what gets merged and what doesn't

I sincerely believe that many teams would benefit from analyzing their pull requests more.

Maybe this could even be automatically analyzed?

Well until then, feel free to read up on my suggestion on how to create and review pull requests [how to pull pull requests off](../posts/pull-requests) here.
