Every Halloween, I think back to the most horrifying task of my career -
the pull request from beyond the grave.

It still haunts me to this very day!

Everything began when I was tasked to merge a certain pull request into the main branch.
"That's going to be a piece of pumpkin cake!" I thought naively.

Little did I know that at that point of time, the pull request had been lying around, abandoned yet not forgotten - for over a year. And it wasn't even completely implemented back then.

After two weeks of implementing the rest - theÂ horror began.
"Okay, now I only need to merge the main branch into this one..."

Several hundred files needed manual merging.

And you want to know what the scariest part of that story is?

It took another couple of months after all of my work for it to be merged as no one could be bothered to approve my pull request. The very attitude that led to this horror story in the first place.

So please remember to always take care of your pull requests as soon as possible, actually I've written a whole blog post on [how to pull pull requests off](../posts/pull-requests) here.
